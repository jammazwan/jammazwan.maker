# jammazwan.maker

jammazwan is a project generator for Camel. It built the [jammazwan.100](https://github.com/jammazwan/jammazwan.100), and is used to build [other example projects](https://github.com/jammazwan/jammazwan.x_index) for me to study with.

It is a personal tool, and not currently targeted at public use. But anyone is welcome to use it.

### Underlying Technology

All jammazwan projects are built from camel-velocity templates. Pretty easy stuff, as these things go.

### If I wanted to use jamazwan.maker anyway...

Anyway? You mean even though it is not documented? 

Start by searching for a couple public static void main( ...

There are two basic routines. 

 * One runs the jammazwan.100 like random project constructs
 * One builds projects from the xyzprojects.json file.
 
### Happy Camel Trails!
